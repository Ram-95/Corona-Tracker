# COVID-19 Analysis [World & India]

### This code tracks the spread of Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) and shows the details such as the number of cases and deaths across the World and India.

This code creates CSV files to store data across the World and India.
  * [COVID-19_Global_Data.csv](COVID-19_Global_Data.csv) - Stores the day-to-day data across the World
  * [COVID-19_India_Data.csv](COVID-19_India_Data.csv) - Stores the day-to-day data across India
  * [COVID-19_Continent_Data.csv](COVID-19_Continent_Data.csv) - Contains the data across Continents
  * [COVID-19_Country_Data.csv](COVID-19_Country_Data.csv) - Contians the data across Countries
  * [COVID-19_State_wise_Information.csv](COVID-19_State_wise_Information.csv) - Contains the data across States in India



The above files are then used for Data Analysis - See [COVID-19_Data_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Ram-95/Corona-Tracker/blob/master/COVID-19_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
