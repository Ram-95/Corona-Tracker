# COVID-19 Analysis [World & India]

### This code tracks the spread of Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) and shows the details such as the number of cases and deaths across the World and India.

This code also creates Three CSV files to store the day-to-day data.
  * COVID-19_Global_Data.csv - Stores the day-to-day data across the World
  * COVID-19_India_Data.csv - Stores the day-to-day data across India
  * COVID-19_State_wise_Information - Stores the state wise detailed information of the affected states in India.

The above files are then used for Data Analysis - See [COVID-19_Data_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Ram-95/Python_Applications/blob/master/Corona%20Tracker/COVID-19_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

#### Below is the snapshot of the data showing the detailed information in India (as on March 28th, 2020).
