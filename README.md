# COVID-19 Analysis [World, India & Indian States]

### This code tracks the spread of Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) and shows the details such as the number of cases and deaths across the World, India and States of India.

This code creates CSV files to store data across the World and India.

  * [COVID-19_India_Data.csv](COVID-19_India_Data.csv) - Stores the day-to-day data across India
  * [COVID-19_Continent_Data.csv](COVID-19_Continent_Data.csv) - Contains the data across Continents
  * [COVID-19_Country_Data.csv](COVID-19_Country_Data.csv) - Contains the data across Countries
  * [COVID-19_State_wise_Information.csv](COVID-19_State_wise_Information.csv) - Contains the data across States in India
  * [COVID-19_Telangana_Data.csv](COVID-19_Telangana_Data.csv) - Contains the day-to-day data across Telangana
  * [COVID-19_Telangana_Districts_Data.csv](COVID-19_Telangana_Districts_Data.csv) - Contains the data across Districts in Telangana
